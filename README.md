# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to my journey in mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). 

It contains various problems with solutions related to DSA topics. 

My goal is to enhance my problem-solving skills

## Motivation
- Improve problem-solving abilities.
- Prepare for technical interviews.
- Strengthen understanding of core computer science concepts.

## Topics Covered

- **Arrays**: Basic operations, searching, sorting, and manipulation of arrays.
- **Linked Lists**: Singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Implementation and problem-solving using stacks and queues.
- **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and tree traversal algorithms.
- **Graphs**: Representation of graphs, graph traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS), shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford).
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort, heap sort, and others.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Understanding and solving problems using dynamic programming techniques.
- **Recursion**: Solving problems using recursive methods.
- **Hashing**: Hash tables, collision handling, and use cases.
